      <p class="intro">
        Hi I am Emma, I am 34 years old, from Castleford in West Yorkshire.
      </p>
      <p class="me">
        I am employed at TJX Europe as a warehouse associate. I am currently
        enrolled at Arden University studying a distance learning degree in
        computer science, and undertaking a front-end development course with
        SheCodes.
      </p>
      <p class="me">
        I am an organised, reliable, and hardworking individual. I take pride in
        all aspects of My life and everything I do. I am a fast learner and not
        afraid of challenges; I embrace hard work. I work well on my own and as
        part of a team. I am punctual and keen to learn new things. I am
        enthusiastic about making things happen and achieving the goals I set
        for myself or those others have set for me. I respond positively and
        rapidly to situations changing at short notice.
